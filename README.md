# react-flask-tut
Simple tutorial for a react.js and flask project.

This tutorial _mostly_ follows https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project.  A couple of changes were made to accommodate the fact that I plan to run the flask application within my IDE, as opposed to in a terminal.
